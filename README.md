# SNVPhyl nf-core Pipeline

This is an [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/)-based pipeline for the [SNVPhyl](https://snvphyl.readthedocs.io) pipeline. The SNVPhyl (Single Nucleotide Variant PHYLogenomics) pipeline is a pipeline for identifying Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV) within a collection of microbial genomes and constructing a phylogenetic tree.

# Installation

You will need to install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) and likely either [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/quick_start.html).

If you are only running the pipeline, you do NOT need to install [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) (Nextflow is sufficient). Installation of the pipeline only requires downloading the code from GitHub:

```
git clone git@github.com:phac-nml/snvphylnfc.git
```

# Running the Pipeline

Navigate to the top-level directory of the pipeline. The pipeline is run as follows:

```
nextflow run main.nf -profile [PROFILE] --input [SAMPLESHEET.csv] --refgenome [REFERENCE.fasta] --outdir [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]
```

- [PROFILE] is either `docker` or `singularity`.
- [SAMPLESHEET.csv] is a CSV-formatted samplesheet describing the sequence ID and read locations. See [this example file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phac-nml/snvphylnfc/main/assets/samplesheet.csv) to see the formatting.
- [REFERENCE.fasta] is a FASTA-formatted reference sequence.
- [OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] is the directory location to write all of the pipeline output.

As an example, you should be able to run the following command without needing to download any data, as the necessary files will be downloaded automatically:

```
nextflow run main.nf -profile singularity --input https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phac-nml/snvphylnfc/main/assets/samplesheet.csv --refgenome https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phac-nml/snvphylnfc/main/assets/samplesheet.csv --outdir results
```
